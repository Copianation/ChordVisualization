# Chord Visualization (Unfinished)

As of now, this is a GUI that allows user to create, play, and apply operations to chords on a Tonnetz. Left click on notes to press. Right click to set rotation center. Note that rotation is not a well defined operation on Tonnetz, so it can behave in unexpected way.
